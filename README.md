This is a database system which enables users, through a shell interface, to add publications/articles and authors, search venues (of publications), authors and obtain other relevant information about an author or article. 

The database uses MongoDb and leverages indexing tables and efficient queries to be able to instantly return a search result on more than 1 million data entries. An example file name "1k.json" is provided to serve as an example for the structure of the files that may be used with the program.
